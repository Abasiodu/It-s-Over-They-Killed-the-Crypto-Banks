# 🚨 Crypto Banking Crisis Overview

## 🏦 Current Banking Crisis in Crypto
The crypto industry is facing major challenges with banking access, worsened by recent regulatory actions. Notable bank failures include:

- **Silvergate Bank**: A key player in the crypto world, which was forced to shut down due to intense scrutiny and pressure.
- **Signature Bank**: Another major crypto-friendly bank that was taken over by the feds.
- **Silicon Valley Bank**: Experienced a historic bank run and was also taken over by the feds, but its failure was unrelated to crypto.

These closures have made it increasingly difficult for crypto companies to access fiat services.

## 🔍 Impact of Regulatory Actions
- **Anti-Crypto Sentiment**: There are allegations that some bank closures were driven by a coordinated effort against the crypto industry, referred to as "Operation Choke Point 2.0."
- **Bank Failures**: The collapse of these banks has led to reduced options for crypto firms to manage their fiat transactions.

## 🏦 Remaining Banks for Crypto
- **Mid-Tier Banks**: The list of banks still working with crypto companies mainly includes regional banks.
- **Major Banks**: Larger banks like JPMorgan Chase and BNY Mellon are selective, often working only with established firms such as Coinbase and Gemini.
- **Open Banks**: Some banks, like Cross River Bank, remain open to crypto clients, but many are cautious and discreet about their involvement.

## 🔮 Future Predictions
1. **🌍 Offshoring**: Many crypto firms may move operations to more crypto-friendly regions, such as Europe. Notable options include Signum Bank in Switzerland.
2. **🏦 Building Banks**: Firms may attempt to create their own banking solutions, though regulatory challenges are significant (e.g., Custodia Bank’s rejection by the Federal Reserve).
3. **🏢 Traditional Finance Involvement**: Large financial institutions like Fidelity and NASDAQ might enter the crypto space, potentially replacing failed crypto-friendly banks.
4. **💪 Increased Resilience**: The industry might become more resilient, with surviving companies adapting to prevent future issues.
5. **📈 Market Stability**: The recent crisis might indicate that the worst is over for the market, with potential for stabilization or growth.

## 📢 Action Steps
- **Advocacy**: Push for favorable regulations and support lobbying efforts to influence policy changes.
- **Support Lobbying**: Consider supporting initiatives like Ryan Selkis’s plan to raise $100 million for lobbying to foster a more crypto-friendly environment.
